        <h2>Air Travel and Tourism in 2023</h2>
        <br>
        As many countries such as Japan and China have lifted COVID bans, there was a great influx of travel in the summer of 2023. However, as air travel rebounds, there was a great increase in plane ticket prices as there were less tickets in comparison to demand. There were also not enough employees due to many workers being layed off due to the pandemic. In the upcoming year of 2024, it is anticipated to balance the issues along with the surging plane tickets as there would be great increases in planes that are available.
